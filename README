Project: Concurrent UNIX Processes and Shared Memory
Course: CS-4760 Operating Systems, Spring 2021
Directory Name: house.2
Included Files: master.c, bin_adder.c, shared.h, Makefile, README, numGen.sh, .git
Files Created: logfile

What this program does: 

		This program computes the sum of n integers using a binary tree of processes. 
	Pairs of integers within a file will be summed together at each depth until a 
	final sum of all values are summed into a single index at depth 0. This is done 
	by using concurrent processes accessing a single shared memory location to perform 
	computations and save their sums. 
		
	Two programs are used to complete this task: master.c & bin_adder.c

	master.c: 
		
		1) parses command line arguments
		2) Creates and allocates space for Shared Memory
		3) Validates and copies contents of datafile into shared memory in a dataArr[]
		4) Creates and tracks n/2 child processes exectutd with exec() to call bin_adder.c
				-User may dictate the number of concurrent processes not to exceed 20
		5) Tracks time of program and will generate signal to terminate and free memory after 
			 given time
				-Default time is 100 seconds and can be altered by user
				-CTRL+C will also send a signal to terminate process and free memory
		6) Cleans up memory
		7) Adds Program Events to Logfile
	
	bin_adder.c:
		
		1) Takes in an index number (xx) and a depth (yy) to perform binary calculations
		2) Each process goes into a waiting que to complete its process by entering a critical
			 section (solution 4 from notes)  to access shared memory one at a time
		3) The sum of two indices is found by adding the value of the dataArr[xx] value to
			 the value of dataArr[xx + pow(2,Initial_Depth - yy)], this sum then written into
			 dataArr[xx].
		4) Sends updates to the console when critical section is entered and exited
		5) Writes updates into logfile


	numGen.sh:

		Included in the directory is a Random Number Generator 

			This project includes a Bash file titles "numGen.sh". This file
		will generate a file of 64 random integers, one  per line in the 
		range [0,256). 

		- To generate a random number file using numGen.sh, execute following:

			$ bash numGen.sh > [datafile_name] 


	To Execute this program perform the following

	1) Run Makefile to compile source files into executables

		$ make

	2) Create a datafile of random integers if needed
		
		$ bash numGen.sh > datafile_name

	3) Execute master.c with user options

		$ ./master [-h] [-s i] [-t time] datafile_name
	
	4) Logfile will be created if there is not one and append a
		 logfile that alread exists

	5) Clean up directy

		$ make clean


	//==== Observations about this Program ====//

	 An observation for using solution 4 to lockout critical memory in my program
	is that the child processes are created quickly and inserted into a shm flag[]. 
	Because of how the flag[] is iterated through, the order the child processes
	are executed by the cpu is not necissarily the same order they where created
	by the parent process.  This could lead to issues when 2 values are dependent
	on each other being updated to the same level. There could be times when one
	value has been summed by a previous process then is called upon again by a 
	process who has yet to be summed by an equivelant previous process. This 
	situation could cause it to produce an inccorect result. A couple ways I 
	thought of to bypass this is by one, limiting processes to 1 or 2 at a time.
	This should allow the processes to run in incrementing order and help ensure
	the sums of two indexes are indeed correct. Another would involve adding a
	another check inside solution 4 to check that the corresponding index that
	will be used has also been updated before entering the critical section.
